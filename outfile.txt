My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than his lips' red;
If snow be white, why then his breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on his head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in his cheeks,
And in some perfumes is thise more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear his speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go -
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare.
